/**
 * @fileoverview By design the mailbox is a list of items, each item is a
 * message. Because of time constrains the mail box list is reloaded each
 * time. For optimization's sake on each request the messages up to the last
 * loaded message are requested. Upon loading all the downloaded messages are
 * overriding the ones that are currently loaded. This means that  the rendered
 * view has no way of knowing if the message has changed. For this reason we
 * make a copy of the data that is currently displayed and after the list is
 * reloaded the segment of it that is displayed need to be compared to the new
 * state. This works as this: if there is one message that is selected we
 * determine its ID, then we load the view as document fragment and check again
 * if this same ID exists, if yes, we mark it as selected and replace the DOM
 * tree on place. If not we simply replace the DOM tree and leave no selected
 * node.
